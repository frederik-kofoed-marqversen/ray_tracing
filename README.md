# Ray Tracing in Rust

This repository is a personal project focused on developing a ray tracing graphics renderer using the Rust programming language. Initiated out of personal interest, the project has been developed intermittently as a hobby. Currently, the renderer operates solely on the CPU, but I do plan on exploring GPU acceleration in the future.

## Rendering an Image

Currently, to render an image, simply run the `main.rs` file and direct standard output to a `.ppm` file. From within the binary (not module) folder, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cargo run --release > image.ppm
```

## TODO

- **Image Post Processing**: Adding low-pass filters. Maybe use Mitchellâ€“Netravali?

- **Upgrade Engine**
    - **Multiple Importance Sampling**: Add direct illumination sampling using [MIS](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Monte_Carlo_Integration/Importance_Sampling).
    - **Stratified sampling**: As a start, use a low-discrepancy sequence for jittering on each pixel.
    - **Pixel Tiles**: Rendering of pixel tiles (e.g., 4x4) instead of lines could improve temporal data locality.

- **Additional Scene Features**
    - **Additional Material Properties**: Such as [Frenel reflectance](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Reflection_Models/Fresnel_Incidence_Effects) for non-dielectrics and also some [Microfacet models](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Reflection_Models/Microfacet_Models).
    - **Additional Lighting**: Add more light source types such as point, parallel, cone, area etc.

- **Additional Procedural Features**
    - **Mesh Topology Fixes**: Fix the mesh topology fixing algorithm to also allow non-connected surfaces.
    - **Vertex Normals and UV Mapping**: Add support for vertex normals and UV mapping to triangle meshes.
    - **Mesh Retriangulation/Optimization**: Implement retriangulation and optimization techniques for meshes with poor topology (Hoppe et al. w. subdivision surfaces has good references).
    - **Subdivision Surface Enhancements**: Incorporate internal crease and corner logic into the subdivision surface algorithm.

- **Accelerators**
    - **GPU**: Self explanatory
    - **General BVH**: Make BVH take a Vec of impl Bounded+Surface objects instead of only Triangle.

- **GUI and Real Time Rendering**: Using e.g. [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) or [imgui](https://docs.rs/imgui)
